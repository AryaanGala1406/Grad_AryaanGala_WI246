how to find out who finishes the race -> cyclic barier 
making sure that all the threads should start at the same point -> countdown latch
reusing threads and not init our own threads -> executor

make a bike racing game 
-> ask you to enter 10 bikers name 
-> ask you to enter the distance coverage in kms
-> display every 100 mts coverage the name of biker
-> the speed should vary for every biker dynamically 
-> display the final dashboard with the rankings, start time, end time, time taken 

Rahul covered 100mrts.
Sam covered 100mrts.
Johm covered 200mrts..

-> all the bikes must be ready but waiting for the countdown 
-> all bikes must run at a time after the countdown reaches to 0
-> in dashboard all the start time, end time and time taken must be displayed (All start time must be same)
